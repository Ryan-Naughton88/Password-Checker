# Password-Checker
The script checks if passwords have been compromised using the Have I Been Pwned API. It hashes input passwords, queries the API, and alerts users if a match is found. The tool prioritizes security by not transmitting actual passwords, offering a quick and effective means to assess password vulnerability.
